# CLOSED LOOP SPEED CONTROL OF DC MOTOR
This is a design of a closed loop speed control system for a 12V DC motor using Arduino. This setup makes the motor spin at a desired rpm and does not allow any load to affect it.

# TERMINOLOGY:
# Module 1: To calculate the rpm of a dc motor.
1.Revolutions per minute 

2.Tachometer

𝒅𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 = 𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 − 𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆

𝒕 = 𝟔𝟎  × 𝟏𝟎𝟎𝟎𝒎𝒔 = 𝟏 𝒎𝒊𝒏𝒖𝒕𝒆

𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒓𝒑𝒎 = 𝒅𝒖𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏

where,

𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 − 𝒑𝒓𝒆𝒗𝒊𝒐𝒖𝒔 𝒕𝒊𝒎𝒆 is time between simultaneous detection of the shaft by the infrared sensor.

𝒕 is the time in seconds as Arduino assigns time in milliseconds. Rpm is hence calculated by the above formula.

# Module 2: To make the dc motor run at a desired speed.
1.Desired rpm

2.Closed loop negative feedback control system

3.Pulse width modulation (PWM)

4.Proportional Controller
 
𝒆𝒓𝒓𝒐𝒓 = 𝒄𝒖𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒏𝒕 𝒓𝒑𝒎 − 𝒅𝒆𝒔𝒊𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒓𝒑𝒎

𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒑𝒘𝒎 = 𝒆𝒓𝒓𝒐𝒓 × 𝑲𝒑

𝒑𝒘𝒎 = 𝒄𝒐𝒓𝒓𝒆𝒄𝒕𝒊𝒗𝒆 𝒑𝒘𝒎 + 𝒑𝒘𝒎

where Kp is the proportionality gain.

Permissible error

𝒓𝒑𝒎(𝒎𝒂𝒙)

𝒑𝒘𝒎(𝒎𝒂𝒙)
